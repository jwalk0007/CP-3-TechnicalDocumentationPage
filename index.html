             <p>Computers are full of amazing technology that can help us in everyday life and also allow us to perform extremely complicated tasks. But without very specific instructions, computers can't do much of anything. Computers need to be programmed. This is where the term "coding" comes in.
</p>
           <li>Coding <i>is</i> Programming</li>
           <br/>
           <p>Computer programs are written in code to ensure that the computer takes the exact action that the programmer intends. Since computers are needed to many different things, the instructions must be extremely precise so that they won't be misinterpreted, resulting in an incorrect response or function. There are many different programming languages and many of them work together. Learning any of these languages can lead to a number of different places, but for many programmers, the journey begins with coding these two words:</p>
           <code><> Hello World < /></code>
          </article>
         </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Languages">
        <header>Languages</header>
        <article>
          <p>There are many programming languages that deal with different aspects of computers and their functions. In fact, the language often used to introduce a user to programming is called HTML, and its not even really considered a "programming" language. It stands for HyperText Markup Language. In HTML, text is categorized and displayed according to that category. Unique use of punctuation and labels (called "tags") differentiate the pieces of text giving them special characteristics which allow the programmer to convey priority or to simply group them together. Another "language" called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is then written to style the groups (through the connection to their "tags"). </p>
           <li>Every webpage was born in HTML and CSS</li>
           <br/>
           <p>From just about any website, email, etc. you can type Ctrl+U or right click on the page and select "View Page Source" to view the code that created the foundation of that page. Early in the text you will probably see links to other pages which contain other instructions (like maybe a link from an HTML code page to one written in CSS) that make the page appear or operate the way that it does. 
             This is where the other programming languages can become even more relevant. One of the most widely used is called JavaScript(JS). Using JS, those first two words mentioned earlier, "Hello World", can also be written different ways to appear in different places. JavaScript is an important programming language, but let's not go down that rabbit hole just yet. For now, here are several examples, written in JS, that would all produce different results.</p>
             <code>console.log(Hello World)
               alert(Hello World)
document.write(Hello World)</code>
</article>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="HTML_Tags">
  <header>HTML Tags</header>
  <article>
    <p>Let's back up. Since most websites, emails, and just about everything on the internet includes the use of HTML, we'll start by discussing the importance of tags and how they are used to accomplish different goals, often simultaneously. </p>
           <li>Tags create Elements</li>
           <br/>
           <p>There are a number of tags in HTML. Once applied, each one is referred to as an Element. For example, after a piece of text is labelled with an h1 tag, anyone talking about that particular piece of text will call it "your h1 Element". 
Tags are created by using the symbols we may have referred to in math class as the "lesser than" symbol ( < ) and the "greater than" symbol ( > ). In coding vernacular I have heard them referred to by those names, but most often by "open carrot" and "close carrot", respectively. An Element is created by using an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the tag between the open and close carrots. In the closing tag, the slash symbol ( / )is needed between the open carrot and the tag name. Not all of Elements require closing tags, but even in those cases the / symbol is required before the close carrot. Here is an example of a "fake" tag, which requires closing, and an "img"(picture) tag, which does not.</p>
           <code>< fake > this is now my "fake" element < /fake>
            <br>
< img= "link-to-picture-here" / ></code>
          </article>
         </section>

          <article>
            <p>CSS is used to make the content written in HTML more visually appealing. It does this by changing text based things like font styles and size, while also adding color and margins. Combining HTML and CSS gives a programmer the ability to make their project available and attractive for display on a digital screen.</p>
           <li>Selectors style Elements</li>
           <br/>
           <p>By using Selectors, a programmer can identify single Elements or groups of them and make changes to their appearance, including shape, color, and placement, to name just a few.
While some Elements have been grouped together and some have not, a programmer must always be very specific when identifying the items they wish to affect with their code. For example, creating margins in CSS can be a lot like making a frame for a painting. The difference is that the painting remains the same and the frame is most often symmetrically built to highlight the one painting inside of it. Margins in CSS can be used to move the underlying text around the page, creating a combination of "paintings" in a complex layout. </p>
          <li> Screen space can be measured in pixels or percentage</li>
          <br>
          <p>When not identified individually, margins specs are listed in the following order: top, right, bottom, left. (In short; clockwise.) Here is an example of an "h2" element being selected and a margin being set for everything within that element. This example would <i>not</i> produce a symmetrical margin. (Can you spot the error?)</p>
           <code>h2 { 
margin: 20px 20% 20px 20px; }</code>

         <section class="main-section" id="Screen_Size">
        <header>Screen Size</header>
        <article>
           <p>Since we all use a variety of different devices from computers to phones to tablets, etc., coding also gives us the opportunity to account for these differences. This is done so that the user will be able to access, view, and interact with the programmers product (like a website or a video game) in multiple environments with maximum useability. In this rapidly changing age of technology, adaptability is a key component to success. Coding in "Media Queries" can allow the same finished product to appear relatively the same on different devices.</p>
           <li>Screen sizes continue to change</li>
           <br/>
           <p>As technology adapts to the changing demands of the user, new devices will be developed. Our phones may get bigger, or smaller again. Maybe computer monitors will grow to the size of our (current) "big screen" tv. Only time will tell. So, when coding Media Queries, it may be a good idea to both- "think big", and think small. Without accounting for the specifics of other products, here is an example that was used in the code for a page like the one you are currently viewing:
</p>
           <code>@media (max-width 400px) {
	#main-doc {
		margin-left: -10px;
  }
}</code>
<p>New languages and technologies continue to develop so if programming is the path you choose, prepare for a long journey. There will always be more to learn.</p>
<br/>
      <p>~Happy Coding!~</p>
